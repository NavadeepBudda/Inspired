# Inspired
Inspired is an app that gives relief to stress, anxiety, and boredom using many techniques. These techniques include playing music depending on their mood, showing calm and relaxing pictures, and inspirational quotes. Using all of these, I created an app utilizing all of these to our best advantage. I also learned that people end up not knowing they have mental health problems for many years, so if someone thinks another person needs the app you can directly share the current quote through it.

# Inspiration
I decided to dedicate my project to try to help solve the mental health crisis. I got inspired after seeing how overlooked the mental health subject was. My motivation got stronger as i realized how many people had mental health issues and then I decided I would find a solution. My solution would help people become more calm, happy, and relaxed.

# What it does
Inspired is an app that gives relief to stress, anxiety, and boredom using many techniques. These techniques include playing music depending on their mood, showing calm and relaxing pictures, and inspirational quotes. Using all of these, I created an app utilizing all of these to our best advantage. I also learned that people end up not knowing they have mental health problems for many years, so if someone thinks another person needs the app you can directly share the current quote through it.

# How I built it
This entire app was made using Swift 5 in Xcode. To design the app I used Adobe XD to visualize the app. I made it so when you swipe a new quote will be shown using a swipe gesture recognizer. I also created a song playing system by using AVAudioPlayer().

# Challenges I ran into
While creating a song playing system I ran into many problems. These problems came from the music not playing to the entire app crashing. I also had many problems with swipe reccongisers as they did not activate once I swiped. These problems held me back but after doing more in depth research on these topics I found out the problems and made sure to fix them.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Having known that I had an effect on helping the mental health community getting through these times has been an accomplishment for me. The purpose of this hackathon for me was to make an effect on this world, and I have achieved it. I am also proud that I completely finished the app and it is now ready for publishing. I am also proud of all the minute details I put into my apps from the music to the user friendly interface.

# What I learned
I learned a lot about app development from design stage in Adobe XD to actually making it in Swift. Today I learned a lot about the programming language Swift and feel a lot more confident now about making an app before. Since this is my first hackathon I learned a lot about this format of competing and am looking forward to my future coding projects in Swift.

# What's next for Inspired
I am going to upload it onto the app store and make it more mainstream for the mental health community to use. It may be a challenge but with my determination I can do it.
